    <p>Drapery adds an elegant and tailored solution to sophisticated Tri-State interiors. Ideal for both residential and commercial settings, drapery enhances privacy, light control, and overall aesthetics. Modern drapery trends favor minimalistic designs, organic fabrics, and versatile tones that blend seamlessly with any d√©cor. Bold prints and luxurious textiles remain popular, offering flexibility and classic appeal.</p>

    <p>Custom drapery typically costs between $250 and $1,500 per window, depending on fabric choice, design details, and size. Though more expensive than ready-made options, custom drapes offer unparalleled quality. They can last 10 to 20 years or more with proper maintenance. Vacuuming drapes every 2 to 4 weeks removes dust and allergens, while gentle washing or professional cleaning (if required) preserves their beauty.</p>

    <p>Floor-to-ceiling lengths, layered textures, lined fabrics, decorative hardware, and luxurious textiles like silk or velvet can make drapes look expensive and timeless. They also provide an additional layer of insulation, aiding temperature regulation and energy efficiency. By choosing custom drapery, homeowners in the Tri-State area can dramatically elevate their interior design, blending style with function in a way that stands the test of time.</p>

    <p>Curtains offer a similar opportunity to add texture and elegance. Available in various price ranges and styles, they allow you to control light and privacy without sacrificing aesthetics. Professional installation ensures that curtains or drapes are hung securely, providing a polished appearance.
